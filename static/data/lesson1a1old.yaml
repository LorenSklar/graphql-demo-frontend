  inquiry: "How do I ask for information using GraphQL?"
  objective: "Discover how to write a basic GraphQL query for a single field"
  workingExample: |
    query {
      ping
    }
  explorationPrompt: "Hit run and see what happens. Then try changing 'ping' to any word you want and run it again.
  reflectionPrompts:
    - "What did you notice about how the server responds to different requests?"
    - "What words and symbols are required? Optional? Different than Python?"
    - "What happens when you ask for something that doesn't exist?"
    - "How do you think the server 'knows' what fields are available?"
    - "How would you describe the process of asking for and receiving information in GraphQL?"
  reflectionTargets:
    - "The server responds with different values for different field requests"
    - "GraphQL does not match Python syntax. Curly braces are still dictionary-like but quotes are not needed for field names"
    - "Error messages help you understand what's available"
    - "The server has built-in knowledge of its own structure"
    - "GraphQL is a conversation between client and server"
